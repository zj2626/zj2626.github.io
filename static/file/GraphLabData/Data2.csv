Let's look over how is this phone's advantages and disadvantages.  Nice box case with this phone. Price is not expensive. This phone also come with a clear phone case. For using it first day  need charged by the way. First need to open back cover  remove the insulating tape from the battery. But can't not find the way to open cover  take a time to look around the phone for a while. Then find out the bottom of phone have little grove  then the phones' cover be open. This part it didn't writing in the manual. If future can get more information from the manual be better save time. Not need to pondering. Back from this phone  the touch screen very sensitive. It can be install two SIM cards as you can see from the picture. The camera function is not bad  definition is enough. It can installing by many languages before using. I try it to call  can easy and clear to hear from other sides. The Vedio screen is also clear. It is a android system for this phone. And it better to get same branch battery  to place up if need. So I need to find extra battery to spare. Overall this phone is great  it will be a wonderful Christmas gift for my grand mom."

I have TW (Taiwan) version with WW (World Wide) firmware. It's fast  has a nice screen  and a decent camera. The only drawback is the battery may drain a little too fast for some heavy users  but its not a problem for me. I get around 2 days out of it with light/moderate usage. It will charge from 10% to 60% in about 35-40 min with included charger. The phone came from Taiwan and included some in-ear headphones and a wall charger that works in U.S. It is dual SIM but only one uses data. I have T-mobile for data (LTE works) and H2O (AT&T;) for voice. Everything works as it should as soon as u pop the SIM cards in without having to go though any setup. I'm happy with my purchase"

From month 9 I started to note that the SIM1 didn’t work. ASUS asked me to take the phone to a repair center  so I had to stay with a backup phone for two weeks  after that the phone worked well a few day and again started to show the same issue. I asked ASUS to change the phone but all they did was to ask me to take the phone again to a repair center  so I did it (again) in month 11 and they replaced the board in charge of the SIMs and it worked well….until month 15 for the same SIM issue  yes  four months after the manufacturer warranty ended and 4 months after the repair center’s warranty. So now  nobody but me has to pay for a failure that my phone had since the beginning and ASUS refuse to fix  doing only soft and useless repairs. So  If you are planning to use this phone for less than a year  have a backup phone and don’t care the poor battery life  go ahead! This is your phone."
"B00W94246I","ASUS ZenFone 2 ZE551ML 4GB RAM / 64GB ROM 5.5-Inch 2G / 4G Dual SIM Factory Unlocked International Stock No Warranty (Gray/Silver)","2.0","Got the Zenfone 2 in late 2015. Just over a year after I bought it  the touch screen failed. I found out after a bit of searching that it was a known manufacturing defect. Fortunately  even though it was more than a year after I bought it (by about one week)  ASUS said the warranty was still valid and repaired it. If it hadn't  I would have bought an LCD and done the repair myself--not easy  but not horribly expensive. But then this year  the battery life dropped dramatically. Ok  I can replace the battery. Again  not easy when it's not designed to be user replaceable  but not expensive. The last straw was when everything else started failing--the camera  the flashlight  the LED indicator  system errors left and right  etc. Fortunately  since I bought it using my Visa card  Visa's extended warranty covered it  but according to the shop I took it to for an estimate  the logic board was failing  and the repair would cost over $200. Visa sent me a check to cover the cost and that was that. But two major hardware failures in two years? Why would I want to risk that again? I'll be shopping for a different brand from now on."

"B075SK4MQY","Samsung Galaxy S6 G920V 32GB Verizon CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Smartphone w/ 16MP Camera - White (Certified Refurbished, Good Condition)","5.0","This is my second s6.  Ruined the original last summer while submerged in the Bitterroot river.  Hot phone  cold river sucked the water into the phone.  Replaced it with a used S5.  Got a good deal(this one) on a refurbished phone.  The phone looked brand new  no scratches and works perfectly.  The S6 is the ultimate smartphone  a finished product.  I enjoy being outdoors and running long distances while listening to music.  The display is excellent and you can see it in direct sunlight.  I use my Garmin 235 with the Garmin Connect software on the phone which turns out to be the perfect combination for outdoor sports.  The camera takes great photo's and it is fast.  Video is excellent.  They have an improved sensor for heartrate  oxygen and stress. Unlike the prior S5  the sensor displays a sine wave and seems to be consistent and accurate.  The glass and metal is a beautiful combo and feels expensive in your hand.  I used an Otter Box on my destroyed S6  while it provides excellent shock resistance  it is not water proof.  Water will destroy this phone  more so than any electronic device I have used in the past..  I purchased a S6 Waterproof Case  Caka [Newest Version] Full-body Underwater Waterproof  for my S6 when I am near water or when it is raining.  the battery seems to last a long time depending on how I am using it."
"B075SK4MQY","Samsung Galaxy S6 G920V 32GB Verizon CDMA 4G LTE Octa-Core Smartphone w/ 16MP Camera - White (Certified Refurbished, Good Condition)","1.0","Save your money and never buy from this sham of a company. I purchased this phone after doing extensive research on what kind of phone I wanted  and this one fit the bill best  so I was excitedly waiting for it to arrive. Activating it on my network wasn't a problem  but I had nothing but problems from then on. For starters  the battery must have been bad because the battery died at a rate of 20-25% per hour during normal use texting and browsing Pinterest. There was a hardware defect in the camera causing permanent blue confetti-like lines in all my photos. When the phone was on the home screen  it would at least once a day vibrate harshly and make a loud noise reminiscent of tuning an old tv to a static channel. I was worried it was going to explode  honestly. I emailed the company around 3pm the day I received the phone about the camera issue and got an automated message saying they were unavailable and to try back during normal business hours. A few days later (around 1pm on a week day) when I had discovered the other defects  I called them. After being put automatically on hold for literally 5 minutes  I got an automated ""We're busy or you called during non-business hours. Call again Mon-Fri  9-5"". I'd be flabbergasted to learn they actually employ people for customer service because I only got repeated automated messages. There is nothing ""Certified"" about this company's products  and the only thing that might be ""Refurbished"" was the packaging. Take your business elsewhere. I bought a new device from a different vendor after returning this one and am much happier."

My advice is dont go to the store and activate yourself on their website.  It takes just 5-10 minutes.  Just make sure to have a Verizon nano SIM card  I was able to use the one from my iphone 6.  Transfer your contacts  music etc on their app as well  it's very easy.  Other than that the actual phone is great.  Very sleek looking phone.  This phone is $756 at Verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but I would much rather pay the cheaper Amazon price and keep my phone bill lower.
